Hi there ! I am a postdoctoral researcher at [MIDST Lab](https://midst.sabanciuniv.edu/), [Sabanci University](https://sabanciuniv.edu/en). My current research focuses on understanding the allosteric regulation mechanism in various protein-based sensors. These genetically engineered tools can be used to track virtually any analyte in a cell via live-cell fluorescence microscopy. They are constructed with a modular design, where ligand binding triggers allosteric changes that affect their spectral characteristics. The prevailing view is that an analyte binding event in the sensing domain triggers a conformational change in the reporter domain (fluorescent protein), causing the sensor to respond to the presence of the ligand.

A major challenge in creating novel sensors lies in predicting—based on static structures or, worse still, sequence data only—how a given design will behave in the cell and whether it will respond to the analyte. To elucidate the key factors dictating sensor performance, I analyzed both “good” and “bad” sensors in terms of their conformational dynamics. To that end, I employ molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. I identified a few key structural metrics that make a sensor highly efficient which can be used to rank different sensor constructs *in silico* and reduce experimental screening times. Recently, we discovered that allosteric hot spots predicted by [Perturbation Response Scanning](http://www.bahargroup.org/prody/manual/reference/dynamics/perturb.html) can accurately pinpoint viable sites best suited to communicate conformational changes to the reporter domain. 

In addition to computational biophysics, I have been involved in various aspects of experimental structural biology. During my Master’s studies at [Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg](https://www.biophysics.uni-freiburg.de/research), I explored the conductance mechanism of bacterial ion transporters using electrophysiology. In this method, the isolated membrane protein is reconstituted into a liposome, and spontaneous ion passage from the outside to the inside of the liposome is measured as electrical current.

Before beginning my PhD, I gained experience in industrial research related to drug production. I worked at a newly established biotech lab of [İlko Pharmaceuticals](https://www.ilko.com.tr/en/rd) in Teknopark, İstanbul, contributing to various development stages of therapeutic antibodies, from cell line development to process scale-ups. I developed biophysical methods to characterize structural integrity, post-translational modifications, and the stability of these antibodies. Owing to the strict regulations in biologics production, I devoted a great deal of effort to validating these methods to ensure they were accurate and reproducible.

Besides my scientific endeavors, I enjoy swimming and reading world literature.
