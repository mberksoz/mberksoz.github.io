  abstract = {Camelidae derived single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), commonly known as nanobodies (Nbs), are the smallest antibody fragments with full antigen-binding capacity. Owing to their desirable properties such as small size, high specificity, strong affinity, excellent stability, and modularity, nanobodies are on their way to overtake conventional antibodies in terms of popularity. To date, a broad range of nanobodies have been generated against different molecular targets with applications spanning basic research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In the field of molecular imaging, nanobody-based probes have emerged as a powerful tool. Radioactive or fluorescently labeled nanobodies are now used to detect and track many targets in different biological systems using imaging techniques. In this review, we provide an overview of the use of nanobodies as molecular probes. Additionally, we discuss current techniques for the generation, conjugation, and intracellular delivery of nanobodies.}
